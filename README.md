# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This is a <b>Data Science Project</b> to detect frauds in Credit Card transactions using the <b>Kaggle Dataset</b>. <br>
In this project, I have used 2 different <b>Machine Learning Algorithms: - Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Algorithm</b>.<br>
While comparing the above two algorithms, the Isolation Forest Algorithm supposedly works far superior for Credit Card Fraud Detection as compared to Local Outlier.<br><br>

<b>NOTE: -</b> I have not used Support Vector Machines due to functionality issues.<br>
However, I will try my level best to update the existing file or make a new file completely dedicated to SVM Model as soon as possible. <br>
