# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This is a Data Science Project to detect frauds in Credit Card transactions using the Kaggle dataset. 
In this project, I have used 2 different Machine Learning Algorithms: - Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Algorithm
While comparing the above two algorithms, the Isolation Forest Algorithm supposedly works far superior for Credit Card Fraud Detection as compared to Local Outlier.
NOTE: - I have not used Support Vector Machines due to functionality issues.
However, I will try my level best to update the existing file or make a new file completely dedicated to SVM Model.
